# The Shoppies


## Overview
This project is meant to show how using the OMDB API, the user can search for their favorite movies and nominate them for a Shoppies award. By typing in a movie title, an array of movies will be returned for the user to select their favorites. Once the user finds a movie they want, it will display below under, "My Nominees". The user is restricted to only picking 5 movies to nominate and going over will result in an error alert.

## Reflection
I want to thank my LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord communities for letting me know about the Shopify Internship and their application process. I had an amazing time developing and learning new techniques while completing this challenge. I look forward to seeing user reactions to the application.
